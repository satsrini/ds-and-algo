  * <h1>DirectedCycle</h1>
  * This class is an implementation for DirectedCycle algorithm
  * <p> Implementation for finding if a given DiGraph is a Directed Acyclic Graph(DAG)
  * or not. The algorithm checks if there is atleast one cycle present in the DiGraph.
  * Also the algorithm finds the path of the cycle present.
